## Step 1: Setting up the project locally

1. Clone the repo to your local machine, or, alternatively, download the project as a zip file and extract it to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in VisualStudioCode or any other editor
3. From the root of the project, run  npm install in one of the terminals
4. Run npm install -g json-server

## Step 2: Starting the backend server

4. To start the server, in the other terminal, run json-server --watch tickets.json You should see a console message saying that the server is running on  http://localhost:3000 and  Resources http://localhost:3000/tickets

## Step 3: Start the Front end server
5. From the other terminal run either ng serve or npm start. This should start the angular  server on an available port (most likely localhost:4200)
